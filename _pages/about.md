I am a scientist with a deep interest in data analytics, mathematical methods and behavioural experimentation. Currently I am a postdoc in the [Sight Enhancement Lab](http://selab.berkeley.edu/) in The School of Optometry at the University of California, Berkeley. My research investigates visual function (e.g. hyperacuity and crowding) and fixational eye movements using traditional psychophysical methods as well as tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.

I undertook a PhD in the school of psychology at The University of Sydney with Prof. Alex Holcombe from 2016 to 2020. My PhD research investigated how the brain selects and prioritises certain visual events from the constantly changing stream of information provided by the visual system. I studied this temporal selection using rapid serial visual presentation and mixture models (i.e. [Ludowici & Holcombe, 2020](https://psyarxiv.com/ar72n)). 

My research intersects with eye movements, attention, and crowding, as well as cognition, computational modelling and open science.  

When I'm not working, you can find me working on my understanding of math, cycling, bike touring, or bushwalking ("backpacking" if you're an American). Please email me if you are interested in collaborating, chatting about research, or if you just want to go for a ride.
