**Currently (Feb - June 2019) I am visiting Jeremy Wolfe's lab at Harvard to learn about medical image perception and visual search.**

I am a PhD candidate in the school of psychology at The University of Sydney. I research how the brain selects and prioritises certain visual events from the constantly changing stream of information provided by the visual system. I study this temporal selection using rapid serian visual presentation and mixture models (i.e. [Goodbourn & Holcombe, 2015](http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/staff/alexh/research/papers/GoodbournHolcombe2015_Postprint_1_0.pdf)). My research intersects with attention, visual search and crowding. I am interested in applied and basic research on all aspects of vision, as well as cognition, computational modelling and open science. I use R for data analysis and Python for programming experiments. 


When I'm not working, you can find me cycle touring, running or bushwalking ("hiking" if you're an American). Please email me if you are interested in collaborating, chatting about research, or if you just want to go for a walk.
