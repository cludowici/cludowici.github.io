I am a PhD candidate in the school of psychology at The University of Sydney, where I research temporal selection in vision using RSVP and mixture models. My research intersects with attention, visual search and crowding. I am interested in applied and basic research on all aspects of vision, as well as cognition, computational modelling and open science. When I'm not working, you can find me cycle touring, running or hiking. Please email me if you are interested in talking about research, or if you just want to go for a hike.
